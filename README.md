# TomoBEAR

[![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/675692608.svg)](https://zenodo.org/badge/latestdoi/675692608)

**TomoBEAR** is a configurable and customizable modular pipeline for streamlined processing of cryo-electron tomographic data and preliminary subtomogram averaging (StA) based on best practices in the scientific research group of Dr. Misha Kudryashev[^1][^2].

## Quick start

### Video-tutorials

We have prepared a range of short (8-12 min) video-tutorials explaining setup, usage and example output of the ```TomoBEAR``` to help you get started with ```TomoBEAR``` based on the [ribosome tutorial](https://github.com/KudryashevLab/TomoBEAR/wiki/Tutorials):
* [Video 1](https://youtu.be/2uizkE616tE): how to get the latest ```TomoBEAR``` version and configure ```TomoBEAR``` and its dependencies;
* [Video 2](https://youtu.be/N93tfAXp990): description of the project configuration file and the pipeline execution;
* [Video 3](https://youtu.be/qbkRtMJp0eI): additional configuration file parameters description, ```TomoBEAR```-```IMOD```-```TomoBEAR``` loop for checking tilt series alignment results and fiducials refinement (if needed);
* [Video 4](https://youtu.be/BP2T_Y7BiDo): checking on further intermediate results (alignment, CTF-correction, reconstruction, template matching).

### Pipeline structure

In the following picture you can see a flow chart of the main `TomoBEAR` processing steps. As the basic input data you can use raw frame movies or already assembled tilt stacks. More on input formats you [can read here](https://github.com/KudryashevLab/TomoBEAR/wiki/Usage.md#input-data-file-formats).

Blue boxes outline the steps that are performed fully automatically, green boxes may require human intervention. The steps encapsulated in the red frame represent the functionality of live data processing. More detailed diagram [is located on wiki](https://github.com/KudryashevLab/TomoBEAR/wiki).

> **Note**
> <br/> Full MATLAB (source code) version of `TomoBEAR` supports workstations and single interactive nodes with GPUs on the computing clusters at the moment. We are also working towards enabling the support of binaries on the mentioned systems as well as support of both source code and binary versions of the `TomoBEAR` on HPC clusters.
