**We are mainly at the stage of testing, debugging and maitenance work. However, new features may still appear and refactorings may still take place. We will be happy, if you would try it out the current version and get back to us by using our [Issue Tracker](https://github.com/KudryashevLab/TomoBEAR/issues) or writing an e-mail to [Artsemi Yushkevich](Artsemi.Yushkevich@mdc-berlin.de?subject=[GitHub]%20TomoBEAR).**

:tada:**The first standalone executable release for GPU workstations is available now! :tada: You may find it on the [Releases page](https://github.com/KudryashevLab/TomoBEAR/releases).**

# TomoBEAR
TomoBEAR is an automated, configurable and customizable full processing pipeline for tomographic cryo-electron microscopy data and subtomogram averaging in the broad field of Cryo-ET based on best practices in the scientific research groups of [Misha Kudryashev](mailto:misha.kudryashev@gmail.com?subject=[GitHub]%20TomoBEAR):
- (previous one) [Independent Research Group (Sofja Kovaleskaja)](https://www.biophys.mpg.de/2149775/members) at the Department of Structural Biology at [MPIBP (Max Planck Institute of Biophysics)](https://www.biophys.mpg.de/en) in Frankfurt (Hesse), Germany;
- (current one) [In situ Structural Biology Group](https://www.mdc-berlin.de/kudryashev) at the [MDCMM (Max Delbrück Center of Molecular Medicine)](https://www.mdc-berlin.de) in Berlin, Germany.

## Documentation
Information on the installation, setup and usage can be found on [TomoBEAR wiki page](https://github.com/KudryashevLab/TomoBEAR/wiki).

## Repository structure
User branches:
- `main` - more or less stable version (*in a normal case use this one, please!*);
- `develop_live` - an experimental (non-stable) version with live data processing functionality (*warning! new functionality and bug fixes from main coming here slowly!*)

All the other branches are not intended for user usage! They hold non-stable development versions (with new features, bug-fixes and refactorings).

In the future we are planning to introduce wiki versioning as well, stay tuned!

## Pipeline structure
In the following picture you can see a flow chart which visualizes which steps `TomoBEAR` will and can do for you in an automated and parallel manner. `TomoBEAR` supports single nodes with GPUs and also some high-performance copmuter clusters.

Note that it is not needed to start from raw data but you can also use already assembled tilt stacks if you provide the angular information.

![Schematic Pipeline Image Dark Mode](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/KudryashevLab/TomoBEAR/main/images/pipeline_dark_mode.svg#gh-dark-mode-only)

Orange processing steps in the flow chart are mandatory and must be executed by TomoBEAR. Yellow boxes are optional and can be activated if desired.

## Feedback

In case of any questions or errors do not hesitate to contact one of the provided persons mentioned in the `Contacts` section below. Alternatively, for bug reports or feature suggestions you may use our [Issue Tracker](https://github.com/KudryashevLab/TomoBEAR/issues). Please, be polite and precise!

## Results example (the tutorial case)

The result shown here have been achieved in an automated manner. The only manual task which needed to be done is the choice of the classes for further processing in between the transition of different binning levels.

### EMPIAR-10064

On the EMPIAR-10064 dataset `TomoBEAR` achieved 11.25 Angstrom (with ~4k particles) as can be seen below on the FSC curve plot:
