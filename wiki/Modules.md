Following you can find descriptions of the functionality of the modules
and their parameters which can be setup in the json file in their
corresponding block.

# General

The general section is not a module but a section where all the general
parameters regarding the processing and the environment can be found.

**Note:** Parameters which are input in this section are visible to all
modules during the execution. If parameters with the same key are found
in a modules block then they override parameters from the general
section.

# StopPipeline

The StopPipeline module is a module which controls the behavior of
tomoBEAR. It allows to stop tomoBEAR after some processing step to
inspect the output and not waste computational resources if parameters
need to be optimized.

| Key              | Default Value | Description                                                                                                   | Examples |
|------------------|---------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------|
| execution_method | "control"     | this variable defines the execution method for the module, **note** for this module it needs to be left as is |          |

```json

# MetaData

The MetaData module collects descriptive statistics such as min, max,
mean, std from the raw data.

| Key                | Default Value | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | Examples |

# MotionCor2

The MotionCor2 module uses as the module's name suggests MotionCor2 to
correct for the sample movement in a given projection which is basically
a dose-fractionated movie.

For some of the options it is advised to look also into the manual of
MotionCor2 as there are some more detailed descriptions which you can
find
[here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfAQm5MA81qTx90W9JL6ClzSrM77tytsvyyHh1ZZWrFByhmfQ/viewform)
or [here](https://emcore.ucsf.edu/ucsf-software) when you download the
archive of MotionCor2.

# CreateStacks

The CreateStacks module creates the stacks and normalizes them. There
are two options for normalization. The default normalization scheme is
to divide the projections by their frame count. TomoBEAR detects
automatically if you are using high-dose images and divides them by

# DynamoTiltSeriesAlignment

The DynamoTiltSeriesAlignment module is using the tilt stacks alignment
algorithm from dynamo which is the best available algorithm for
fiducial-based alignment. As default reasonable parameters for many cryo
ET projects are set. Some of them are dynamically derived. The option to
override non-dynamically derived parameters is still available and can
be done in the json configuration file.

# DynamoCleanStacks

The DynamoCleanStacks module can be run after the
DynamoTiltSeriesAlignment to automatically clean up the tilt stacks. For
that **DynamoCleanStacks** uses the output from dynamo tilt stacks
alignment which states on which projections the fiducials could be fit.
The others are then removed from the tilt stacks for further processing.

| defocus_tolerance                 | 20                   | this variable sets the "-defTol" argument from ctfphaseflip from the IMOD package: Defocus tolerance in nanometers, which is one factor that governs the width of the strips. The actual strip width is based on the width of this region and several other factors: a fixed minimum width of 128, a minimum width required to achieve sufficient resolution in the Fourier transform, governed by the the 0zero option, and the dynamic adjustment of maximum width described above.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |          |
| iWidth                            | 2                    | this variable sets the "-iWidth" argument from ctfphaseflip from the IMOD package: The distance in pixels between the center lines of two consecutive strips. A pixel inside the region between those two center lines resides in both strips. As the two strips are corrected separately, that pixel will have 2 corrected values. The final value for that pixel is a linear interpolation of the 2 corrected values. If a value of 1 is entered, there is no such interpolation. For a value greater than one, the entered value will be used whenever the strip width computed from the defocus tolerance is less than 256 (i.e., at high tilt), and the value will be scaled proportional to the strip width for widths above 256. This scaling keeps the computational time down and is reasonable because the defocus difference between adjacent wide strips at wider intervals is still less than that between the narrower strips at high tilt. However, strips at constant spacing can still be obtained by entering the negative of the desired spacing, which disables the scaling of the spacing |          |
| ampContrast                       | 0.1                  | this variable sets the "-ampContrast" argument from ctfphaseflip from the IMOD package: The fraction of amplitude contrast. For Cryo-EM, it should be between 0.07 and 0.14. The value should be the same as was used when detecting the defocus.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |          |

# BinStacks

The BinStacks module is used for binning the stacks to be able to
reconstruct them with the Reconstruct module which should be used after
your stacks are binned.

| defocus_tolerance               | 20            | this variable sets the "-defTol" argument from ctfphaseflip from the IMOD package: Defocus tolerance in nanometers, which is one factor that governs the width of the strips. The actual strip width is based on the width of this region and several other factors: a fixed minimum width of 128, a minimum width required to achieve sufficient resolution in the Fourier transform, governed by the the 0zero option, and the dynamic adjustment of maximum width described above.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |          |
| iWidth                          | 2             | this variable sets the "-iWidth" argument from ctfphaseflip from the IMOD package: The distance in pixels between the center lines of two consecutive strips. A pixel inside the region between those two center lines resides in both strips. As the two strips are corrected separately, that pixel will have 2 corrected values. The final value for that pixel is a linear interpolation of the 2 corrected values. If a value of 1 is entered, there is no such interpolation. For a value greater than one, the entered value will be used whenever the strip width computed from the defocus tolerance is less than 256 (i.e., at high tilt), and the value will be scaled proportional to the strip width for widths above 256. This scaling keeps the computational time down and is reasonable because the defocus difference between adjacent wide strips at wider intervals is still less than that between the narrower strips at high tilt. However, strips at constant spacing can still be obtained by entering the negative of the desired spacing, which disables the scaling of the spacing |          |
| ampContrast                     | 0.1           | this variable sets the "-ampContrast" argument from ctfphaseflip from the IMOD package: The fraction of amplitude contrast. For Cryo-EM, it should be between 0.07 and 0.14.

# Reconstruct

The Reconstruct module should be used after you binned the tilt stacks
with the BinStacks module or used aligned tilt stack binning option
greater than one. The module is set up by default to reconstruct binned
stacks. If you otherwise want to reconstruct unbinned stacks you need to
set up the Reconstruct module properly.

# DynamoImportTomograms

The DynamoImportTomograms module generates a dynamo catalogue for you
and inputs the tomograms to that catalogue. After that you can call the
dynamo catalogue manager (dcm) to generate the models for the tomograms
or pick in them particles by hand.

# EMDTemplateGeneration

The EMDTemplateGeneration module is used to automatically download a
EMDB template which is further down-scaled to match your desired template
matching binning. Besides that an automated routine to generate the mask
is also implemented. This module needs to be run before template
matching is executed.

# TemplateGenerationFromFile
The concept of this module is the same as in EMDTemplateMatching, with the only difference of taking the template from a user-defined path instead of fetching it directly from EMDB.

# DynamoTemplateMatching

The DynamoTemplateMatching module re-implements the template
matching from Dynamo but on a GPU. Because of the GPU usage the whole
thing runs up to 15 times faster than the normal template matching
implementation of dynamo.
